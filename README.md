## Title
SHOP-SHOP-REDUX-STORE

## Description
challenge this week is to refactor the e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux (Links to an external site.). You won’t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. We’ve provided some guidelines to point you in the right direction in the Getting Started section below.

Run `npm install` to install all packages and `npm run develop` to test locally. Once everything is good deploy to Heroku or other cloud provider or host in our hosting environment (CentOS or Ubuntu)

## Usage
Once application starts hit `http://localhost:3000` to test using browser and `http://localhost:3001` to test the graphql queries and such

## Contributing
